# Logic

## Introduction

Logic is like the rulebook for clear thinking. It helps us make sense of things, make good decisions, and figure out if arguments are right or wrong. Imagine it as the guide that shows us how to think straight.

Back in the day, stoics and Aristotle started thinking about how we can reason well, and that's where logic comes from. Now, Logic is used in math, computers, language, and more.

We'll explore the basics.

## Propositional Logic

Propositional Logic is like the building blocks of logical thinking.
It deals with simple statements, sentences, assertions or propositions (all synonyms), and how we can combine them to form more complex ideas. These propositions can be true or false.

Examples of proposition are : "Every human is mortal", "Marty has a dog", "If it rains, I will take my umbrella", "Paris is the capital of France", "George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the United States".

The following are not propositions: "I hope you will pass the exam", "Are you tired?", "I think that all the crows are black".

A statement/proposition can be defined as a declarative sentence, or part of a sentence, that is capable of having a truth-value, such as being true or false.

Example: the proposition "Marty has a dog" (symbolised with a letter of the alphabet, P, for example) is true if Marty has a dog and False, otherwise.

We can write:

- "Marty has a dog" is true if and only if Marty has a dog
- P is true if and only if Marty has a dog.

"George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the United States and Paris is the capital of France" It's a statement formed by 2 statements linked by an 'and'.

The first sentence is: "George W. Bush is the 43rd President"
The second sentence is: "Paris is the capital of France"

When dealing with Propositional Logic is important to learn about truth tables.

## Predicative Logic

Predicative or Predicate Logic. If Propositional Logic is like dealing with simple building blocks, then predicate logic is like putting those blocks together to create more complex structures.
Predicate Logic allows us to use variables and quantifiers (like "some" or "all") to talk about relationships and properties.

## Set theory

Set theory is like the language of mathematics, and it plays a crucial role in logical reasoning. Imagine sets as collections of things, like a bag of marbles or a group of numbers. Set theory helps us describe, organize, and manipulate these collections logically.

In set theory, elements are the individual things in a set, and we can combine sets, find their intersections, or compare their sizes. For example, we might have a set of even numbers or a set of animals with fur.

Now, here's where it gets interestingâ€”set theory is closely linked to logic because it provides a formal way to represent logical relationships. We use sets to model ideas and statements. If we say "All dogs are mammals," we can represent dogs and mammals as sets and see how they overlap.

Logical operations, like "and," "or," and "not," can be translated into set operations, creating a bridge between set theory and logic. For instance, the intersection of two sets corresponds to the logical "and" operation.

In essence, set theory provides a structured way to organize and represent information, making it a powerful tool in logical thinking. The connection between set theory and logic is so strong that they often go hand in hand, working together to help us reason, analyze, and understand the world around us.

## PROLOG

Prolog, short for "Programming in Logic," is a programming language designed for dealing with symbolic reasoning and problem-solving. Unlike traditional languages, Prolog is distinctive in its focus on logic and the manipulation of knowledge represented in the form of facts and rules.
The language is used in areas such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and expert systems.
Another interesting language is LISP, which is a functional programming language based on lambda calculus.

## LaTeX

LaTeX is a typesetting system widely used for creating documents with complex formatting, particularly in academia and technical fields.
Favored for its versatility and ability to handle mathematical equations and scientific notations seamlessly, so it is able to write nicely formulas used in Logic and logical proofs.
