# Logic

## Introduction

Logic is like the rulebook for clear thinking. It helps us make sense of things, make good decisions, and figure out if arguments are right or wrong. Imagine it as the guide that shows us how to think straight.

Back in the day, stoics and Aristotle started thinking about how we can reason well, and that's where logic comes from. Now, Logic is used in math, computers, language, and more.

We'll explore the basics.

## Propositional Logic

Propositional Logic is like the building blocks of logical thinking.
It deals with simple statements, sentences, assertions or propositions (all synonyms), and how we can combine them to form more complex ideas. These propositions can be true or false.

Examples of proposition are : "Every human is mortal", "Marty has a dog", "If it rains, I will take my umbrella", "Paris is the capital of France", "George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the United States".

The following are not propositions: "I hope you will pass the exam", "Are you tired?", "I think that all the crows are black".

A statement/proposition can be defined as a declarative sentence, or part of a sentence, that is capable of having a truth-value, such as being true or false.

Example: the proposition "Marty has a dog" (symbolised with a letter of the alphabet, P, for example) is true if Marty has a dog and False, otherwise.

We can write:

- "Marty has a dog" is true if and only if Marty has a dog
- P is true if and only if Marty has a dog.

"George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the United States and Paris is the capital of France" It's a statement formed by 2 statements linked by an 'and'.

The first sentence is: "George W. Bush is the 43rd President"
The second sentence is: "Paris is the capital of France"

When dealing with Propositional Logic is important to learn about truth tables.

## Predicative Logic

Predicative or Predicate Logic. If Propositional Logic is like dealing with simple building blocks, then predicate logic is like putting those blocks together to create more complex structures.
Predicate Logic allows us to use variables and quantifiers (like "some" or "all") to talk about relationships and properties.
