# Logic

## Introduction

Logic is like the rulebook for clear thinking. It helps us make sense of things, make good decisions, and figure out if arguments are right or wrong. Imagine it as the guide that shows us how to think straight.

Back in the day, stoics and Aristotle started thinking about how we can reason well, and that's where logic comes from. Now, Logic is used in math, computers, language, and more.

We'll explore the basics.

## Propositional Logic

Propositional Logic is like the building blocks of logical thinking.
It deals with simple statements, or propositions, and how we can combine them to form more complex ideas. These propositions can be true or false.
When dealing with Propositional Logic is important to learn about truth tables.
